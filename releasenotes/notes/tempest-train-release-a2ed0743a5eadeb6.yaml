prelude: |
    This release is to tag the Tempest for OpenStack Train release.
    This release marks the start of Train release support in Tempest.
    After this release, Tempest will support below OpenStack Releases:

    * Train
    * Stein
    * Rocky
    * Queens

    Current development of Tempest is for OpenStack Ussuri development
    cycle. Every Tempest commit is also tested against master during
    the Ussuri cycle. However, this does not necessarily mean that using
    Tempest as of this tag will work against a Ussuri (or future release)
    cloud.
    To be on safe side, use this tag to test the OpenStack Train release.
