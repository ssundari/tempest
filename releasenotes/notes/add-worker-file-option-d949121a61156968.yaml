    Add the option --worker-file in ``tempest run`` command. This is to give
    tempest more granularity to manually configure how the different sets of
    tests can be grouped to run with the different worker. You can configure
    tests regex to run under workers. You can also mix manual scheduling with
    standard one by mentioning concurrency.
    For example, the user can setup tempest to run with different concurrences,
    to be used with different regexps.
