    This release is to tag the Tempest for OpenStack Ussuri release.
    This release marks the start of Ussuri release support in Tempest.
    After this release, Tempest will support below OpenStack Releases:

    * Ussuri
    * Train
    * Stein

    Current development of Tempest is for OpenStack Victoria development
    cycle. Every Tempest commit is also tested against master during
    the Victoria cycle. However, this does not necessarily mean that using
    Tempest as of this tag will work against a Ussuri (or future release)
    cloud.
    To be on safe side, use this tag to test the OpenStack Ussuri release.
