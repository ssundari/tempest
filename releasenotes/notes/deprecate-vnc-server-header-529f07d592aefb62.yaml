deprecations:
  - |
    The config option ``CONF.compute.vnc_server_header`` is deprecated because
    it has become obsolete with the usage of different response header fields
    to accomplish the same goal in accordance with RFC7231 Section 6.2.2.

fixes:
  - |
    Adequately validates WebSocket upgrade in test_novnc and removes unneeded
    configuration complexity. Closes bug #1838777 and #1840788.
