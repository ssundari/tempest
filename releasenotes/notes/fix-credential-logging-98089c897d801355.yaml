    A new kwarg, ``log_req_body``, was added to the
    ``tempest.lib.common.rest_client.RestClient`` method ``raw_request()``.
    This kwarg takes in a string which will be used in place of the request
    body, which is logged by default. The intent of this option is to be used
    for security reasons to avoid logging sensitive information that are part
    of request bodies.
