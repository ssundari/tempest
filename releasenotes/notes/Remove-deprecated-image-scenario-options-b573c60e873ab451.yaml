    The following deprecated image scenario options are removed after a ~4
    year deprecation period.

    * ``ami_img_file``
    * ``ari_img_file``
    * ``aki_img_file``

    Starting Tempest 25.0.0 release, CONF.scenario.img_file need a full path
    for the image. CONF.scenario.img_dir was deprecated and will be removed
    in the next release. Till Tempest 25.0.0, old behavior is maintained and
    keep working but starting Tempest 26.0.0, you need to specify the full path
    in CONF.scenario.img_file config option.
