deprecations:
  - |
    The ``[compute-feature-enabled]/block_migrate_cinder_iscsi`` is deprecated
    ahead of removal in a future release. Once removed the
    ``[compute-feature-enabled]/block_migration_for_live_migration``
    configurable will then be used to determine when to run block migration
    based tests during live migration.
